# eCommerceTemplate
This project is centered around creating a template for an eCommerce website integrated with SQL. It is intended to easily allow a company to insert their own specific information without undergoing the labor of creating the website from scratch. It uses JavaScript, EJS, and CSS for the design of the website and PostgreSQL for managing the relational database.
